# ML_based_HRTF_Prediction
This project tries to tackle the problem of HRTF prediction. The idea of the present approach is to use the K-Nearest-Neighbor-Algorithm in order to learn a set of HRTFs with the according azimuth and elevation angles. This learned information is then used in order to generate HRTFs of new angular positions. 

Please note: The HRTF dataset used in this work (‘SADIE_003_DFC_256_order_fir_48000.sofa’) is taken from the SADIE database. The dataset is the property of its original authors/providers. I do not own any rights to the data. Usage is solely for research/educational purposes.
