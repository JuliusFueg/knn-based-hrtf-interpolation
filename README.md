# ML_based_HRTF_Prediction
This project tries to tackle the problem of HRTF prediction. The idea of the present approach is to use the K-Nearest-Neighbor-Algorithm in order to learn a set of HRTFs with the according azimuth and elevation angles. This learned information is then used in order to generate HRTFs of new angular positions.
